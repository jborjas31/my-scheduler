TO DO:
1. Multi-hour tasks don't span the corresponding hours on the schedule grid.

1. Fix Cross-Midnight Scheduling Logic
    Claude says: The main problem is in your time validation logic - when someone enters "11:30 PM" start and "2:30 AM" end, the app needs to recognize that the AM time refers to the next day, not earlier the same day.
    Quick questions to help me understand the bug better:

    When you create a cross-midnight task (like 11:30 PM to 2:30 AM), what does the app currently show for:

    Duration calculation?
    The time display in the schedule?


    If you create that task and then check at midnight, does the dashboard show it as "Right Now" or does it disappear?
    What time format are you usually entering - 12-hour (11:30 PM) or 24-hour (23:30)?

    Once I understand exactly how the bug manifests, I can walk you through fixing the validateTaskTimes() function step-by-step. The fix will likely involve updating the logic to properly detect when an end time should be interpreted as "next day" rather than just comparing the raw minute values.

2. Quick Add Task functionality
    Quick Add Task functionality should allow user to quickly add a task name and notes (optional) that can be scheduled in the moment or left pending.

3. Add "Recurring" functionality
    Daily, Weekly, Monthly (what about days ), Yearly

4. Add location field
    Implement a rudimentary way for the web app to calculate time between tasks at different locations
